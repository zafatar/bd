I received the B.S. degree in 2005, the M.Sc. degree in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in 2010, all in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from <a href="http://www.kocaeli.edu.tr/int/">Kocaeli University</a>, Turkey. During 2005-2010, I was a research and teaching assistant at <a href="http://kulis.kocaeli.edu.tr/index_en.php">KULIS (Kocaeli University Laboratory of Image and Signal processing)</a>. After my Ph.D, I moved to Italy,  and during 2010-2013 I worked as a Post-Doc researcher at the <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/rslab/index.php" target="_blank">Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSLab)</a>, <a href="http://disi.unitn.it" target="_blank">Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science</a>, University of Trento. Since 2013, I'm an Assistant Professor at the same department and a member of the RSLab. My main research interests include image processing and machine learning with applications to remote sensing image analysis. I'm a senior member of IEEE since 2016.
